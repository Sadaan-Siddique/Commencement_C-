Program = (IDE sent this program to compiler)--> compiler --(Can sent it to CPU or memory)--> CPU ---> Processor(Brain of computer)

VARIABLE
   is a container or anything in which we store the information 
   (data). It is a way to store the data in the computer's memory.
   Variables are your way to access your computer's memory.

DIRECTORIES
   A directory is a container for organizing files and other 
   directories in computer.
   Directories are structured in a hierarchical way, with the root 
   directory at the top.

   Command-line tools like cd, ls, and pwd allow you to navigate and 
   manipulate directories in the command-line interface.
   Directories help keep your files organized, making it easier to 
   locate and manage your projects, documents, and system files.
   Packing = Libraries and modules are same thing.

Console commands (Linux):
   ls = list all files in the current directory in which I'm currently working.
   cd = change directory (e.g., cd Star_of_C)
   pwd = print working directory (e.g., /home/Star_of_C)
   To run the C++ code, type : 'g++ hello.cpp -o C++' then type 'Enter' then type './C++.exe'

PowerShell interprets ' & ' as a special operator. So it throws the error : The ampersand (&) character is not allowed.

C++ treats spaces inside the number as multiple tokens â†’ invalid constant.
like : #define pi 3.14159 26535 89793 ...
instead 
#define pi 3.14159265358979323846
